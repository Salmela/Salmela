## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

Here are a few projects I've been working on recently:

- **[Learn-helsinki](https://github.com/Salmela/learn-helsinki)**: Quiz game to learn places and names in Helsinki inspired by duolingo.
- My christmas project was writing toy gpu on fpga.
- Thumbnail microservice for giosg
- **[Pelix](https://salmela.dev/demoes/pelix/)**: Parser, interpreter and debugger for little toy language that I did in the middle of lapland without any tools. I did use [existing parsing library](https://github.com/dmaevsky/rd-parse), but I ended up rewriting it as it's parsing algorithm was too slow
- **[Nano inkscape](https://salmela.dev/demoes/nano_inkscape/draw.htm)** Very old vector graphics program that I did
- Many of my projects are not in github

## ‚ö° Fun Facts about me

- I enjoy cooking and baking cakes.
- I know interactive debuggers and I am not afraid of using them
- Our company's (giosg) AI expert called me "koodijumalaksi" (code god) üòÇ

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on a project.
